# Interstellar

You are a citizen of the planet Lunaro, home to a colony of humans who settled here recently. Although previously thriving, recent climate pollution — manifesting as a cloud of gases encasing the planet, blocking solar energy — has thrown the lives of millions into jeopardy.

When disaster began to loom, however, a researcher discovered an Ancient Greek myth suggesting the existence of spirits living in the constellations. These findings were presented to the space administration, who begrudgingly approved a flight to the constellation of rebirth — the Phoenix — to acquire a "rebirth" of their home. Such a journey would drain the last of Lunaro's energy supply, making this an extremely high-stakes mission.

You, a professional space traveller, have been entrusted to pilot this flight. To complete your goal, you need to venture to three of the constellation's stars and collect samples. When fused with each other, the researcher believes, these samples can summon the Phoenix.

Your craft is equipped with a set of mixtures that can each dissolve certain debris, which you must utilise combined with precision steering skills in order to protect you and your ship.
